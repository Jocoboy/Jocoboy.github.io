# :file_folder:Contents

## :one:_config.yml

Site configuration file. You can configure most settings here.

## :two:package.json

Application data. The EJS, Stylus and Markdown renderers are installed by default. If you want, you can uninstall them later.

## :three:scaffolds

Scaffold folder. When you create a new post, Hexo bases the new file on the scaffold.

## :four:source

Source folder. This is where you put your siteâ€™s content. Hexo ignores hidden files and files or folders whose names are prefixed with _ (underscore) - except the _posts folder. Renderable files (e.g. Markdown, HTML) will be processed and put into the public folder, while other files will simply be copied.

## :five:themes

Theme folder. Hexo generates a static website by combining the site contents with the theme.
